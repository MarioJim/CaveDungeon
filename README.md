# Cave Dungeon
As the final project in Orient Objected Programming, we will create an RPG that takes place inside a cave.

## Run and debug
Run Gradle from the root of the project.
You can use `./gradlew run`.

## Assets
We used two asset packs:
 - [Kyrise's Free 16x16 RPG Icon Pack](https://kyrise.itch.io/kyrises-free-16x16-rpg-icon-pack)
 - [0x72's Dungeon Tileset II](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii)
